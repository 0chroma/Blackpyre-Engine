--v8-prefix=/install/path/to/v8
	Tells configure to look for v8 under the given dir. It expects
	to find include/v8.h and lib/libv8(_g).(a|so).

--disable-plugins
	Explicitly disable building the plugins.

--enable-debug
	This standard option enables compiler debugging flags but also
	tells the configure script to prefer libv8_g (the debugging
	version of v8) over libv8. If it cannot find libv8_g it will
	try to fall back to libv8.
