You can download toc2 from http://toc.sourceforge.net

After obtaining toc2, do ONE of the following:

1) Set the TOC2_HOME environment variable to the path containing toc2/bin
   and toc2/sbin. For example, in the bash shell one would use:
   export TOC2_HOME=/path/to/toc2

2) Copy or symlink the 'toc2' tree into the s11n source directory OR one
   directory above the s11n tree. If the original is called toc2-VERSION,
   then name the copy/symlink 'toc2'.

EOF
    exit 1
}

echo "Using TOC2_HOME: ${TOC2_HOME}"
