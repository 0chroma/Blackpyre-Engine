# ^^^ help out emacs
# Makefile snippet to traverse subdirs.
# Sample usage:
#    package.subdirs = foo bar
#    include toc2.make
#    all: subdirs
#
# NOTES:
#
#  - package.subdirs must be defined BEFORE including this file. This is a
# side-effect of the implementation: make expands this var
# at compile time, so to say, so it can build the proper subdir
# targets. Adding to the package.subdirs var later doesn't affect which targets
# get created, but ARE necessary for targets like install-subdirs :/.
#
#  - You can add subdirectories post-include by doing this:
#    subdirs: subdir-XXXX
# where XXX is a directory, but that has the disadvantage of not adding
# the subdir to the, e.g., cleanup or install list when those traverse
# subdirs.
#
#  - You can also use:
#    subdirs: subdirs-XXX
#  which runs XXX in all $(package.subdirs).
#
# DO NOT put "." in the package.subdirs! Instead, client Makefiles completely
# control dir build order via dependencies.

# Note that this approach makes parallel builds between the dirs in
