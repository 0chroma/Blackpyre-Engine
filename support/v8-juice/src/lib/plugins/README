The v8-juice plugins are stored in a separate source repository,
which can be browsed here:

http://code.google.com/p/v8-juice/source/browse/extra-plugins

Or checked out with subversion:


svn checkout http://v8-juice.googlecode.com/svn/extra-plugins/ 

Each plugin may have its own licensing terms and requirements,
e.g. 3rd-party libraries.

To build them, you need to have 'libv8-juice-config' in your PATH
(it gets installed with v8-juice) or you'll need to tweak
plugin_template.make to suit your setup.

After that is done, simply:

   cd src/PluginName
   make && make install
