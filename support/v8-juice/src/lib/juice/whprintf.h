/**@page whprintf_page_main whprintf: generic printf-like utilities

   This API contains a printf-like implementation which supports
   aribtrary data destinations.

   Authors: many, probably. This code supposedly goes back to the
   early 1980's.

   Current maintainer: Stephan Beal (http://wanderinghorse.net/home/stephan)

   License: Public Domain.

   The primary functions of interest are whprintfv() and whprintf(), which works
   similarly to printf() except that they take a callback function which they
   use to send the generated output to arbitrary destinations. e.g. one can
   supply a callback to output formatted text to a UI widget or a C++ stream
   object.

/**
   @typedef long (*whprintf_appender)( void * arg, char const * data, long n )


   The whprintf_appender typedef is used to provide whprintfv()
   with a flexible output routine, so that it can be easily
   send its output to arbitrary targets.

   The policies which implementations need to follow are:

   - arg is an implementation-specific pointer (may be 0) which is
   passed to vappendf. whprintfv() doesn't know what this argument is
   but passes it to its whprintf_appender. Typically it will be an
   object or resource handle to which string data is pushed or output.

   - The 'data' parameter is the data to append. If it contains
   embedded nulls, this function will stop at the first one. Thus
   it is not binary-safe.

   - n is the number of bytes to read from data. If n<0 then
   strlen(data) should be used.

   - Returns, on success, the number of bytes appended (may be 0).

   - Returns, on error, an implementation-specified negative number.
   Returning a negative error code will cause whprintfv() to stop the
   processing of that string. Note that 0 is a success value (some
   printf format specifiers do not add anything to the output).

/**
  This function works similarly to classical printf implementations,
  but instead of outputing somewhere specific, it uses a callback
  function to push its output somewhere. This allows it to be used for
  arbitrary external representations. It can be used, for example, to
  output to an external string, a UI widget, or file handle (it can
  also emulate printf by outputing to stdout this way).

 INPUTS:

 pfAppend : The is a whprintf_appender function which is responsible
 for accumulating the output. If pfAppend returns a negative integer
 then processing stops immediately.

 pfAppendArg : is ignored by this function but passed as the first
 argument to pfAppend. pfAppend will presumably use it as a data
 store for accumulating its string.

 fmt : This is the format string, as in the usual printf().

 ap : This is a pointer to a list of arguments.  Same as in
 vprintf() and friends.


 OUTPUTS:

 The return value is the total number of characters sent to the
 function "func", or a negative number on a pre-output error. If this
 function returns an integer greater than 1 it is in general
 impossible to know if all of the elements were output. As such
 failure can only happen if the callback function returns an error,
 and this type of error is very rare in a printf-like context, this is
 not considered to be a significant problem. (The same is true for any
 classical printf implementations, as far as i'm aware.)


 CURRENT (documented) PRINTF EXTENSIONS:

 %%z works like %%s, but takes a non-const (char *) and vappendf
 deletes the string (using free()) after appending it to the output.

 %%h (HTML) works like %s but converts certain characters (like '<' and '&' to
 their HTML escaped equivalents.

 %%t (URL encode) works like %%s but converts certain characters into a representation
 suitable for use in an HTTP URL. (e.g. ' ' gets converted to %%20)

 %%T (URL decode) does the opposite of %t - it decodes URL-encoded
 strings.

 %%r requires an int and renders it in "ordinal form". That is,
 the number 1 converts to "1st" and 398 converts to "398th".

 %%q quotes a string as required for SQL. That is, '\'' characters get
 doubled.
m
 %%Q as %%q, but includes the outer '\'' characters and null pointers
 replaced by SQL NULL.

 (The %%q and %%Q specifiers are options inherited from this printf
 implementation's sqlite3 genes.)

 These extensions may be disabled by setting certain macros when
 compiling vappendf.c (see that file for details).
